FPGA Course Progress and Learnings
This repository tracks my progress and learnings from the FPGA course I took on the Coursera platform. It includes all the codes and files generated during the assessments.

Repository Contents
VHDL Codes: Contains VHDL code snippets and complete programs written for various assignments and projects.
Simulation Outputs: Stores the output files from simulations and tests run on the VHDL code.
Documentation: Includes notes, explanations, and insights gained during the course.
Course Overview
The FPGA course provided an in-depth understanding of designing digital circuits using VHDL, synthesizing designs, and implementing them on FPGA hardware. Key topics covered include:

Basic VHDL Syntax and Structures
Combinational and Sequential Logic Design
Finite State Machines (FSM)
Majority Vote Circuit Design
FPGA Implementation and Testing
